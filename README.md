# Materials-Surface-Classification
The aim of this project is to classify surfaces based on certain features such as visual, audio and haptic data. Mainly 4 features are being used is this experiment, namely:
1. Acceleration
2. Friction
3. Audio
4. Image

Variuos ML models are used for classification, namely:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. SVM
5. Neural Network
